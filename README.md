### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Southern California working with Dr. Megan Herting in the Environmental Health Sciences Division of the Department of Population and Public Health Sciences in the Keck School of Medicine. Currently, my research focuses on understanding both within- and between-individual variability in development, and developing interpretable machine learning approaches to better understand the developing brain.  

Open science is important to me, in most senses of the term. I am passionate about developing open neuroimaging software and resources. But beyond developing and sharing tools, I find it important to provide resources and instruction to increase their utility, encourage others to engage in open science practices, and further democratize access to scientific tools, ideas, and knowledge. Futhermore, I am passionate about visualizing and communicating research findings, to this end.

I am currently developing an open pipeline for analyzing individual differences in brain connectivity, incorporating principles from neuroimaging, network science, and machine learning.
